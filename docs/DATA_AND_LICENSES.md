# Data, Licensing, Attribution & Safety Checklist

**Status: unverified checklist, not legal advice.** Confirm each source's CURRENT terms directly before use, publication, training, or distribution. Record source URL, publisher, license/version, verification date, permitted uses and obligations.

| Asset/data | Intended use | Questions before use |
|---|---|---|
| OpenStreetMap | Directed street graph, roadway tags | ODbL attribution, derivative database/sharing rules, geocoding/Overpass/tiles usage policy, extract date |
| Project PLATEAU | 3D city models, road/building geometry where available | Dataset-by-dataset terms, city/year/version, texture/third-party restrictions, hosting and attribution |
| Elevation/terrain | Terrain-aware visualizations | Source, vertical datum, resolution, accuracy, redistribution, regional coverage |
| CesiumJS / OSMnx / NetworkX | Code libraries | Current open-source license and required notices |
| Generic vehicle glTF/GLB | Animated route follower | Asset provenance, redistribution and allowed modifications; no unlicensed branded designs |
| F1 / WRC / circuit references | Inspiration for user preference labels | Avoid claiming endorsement, official FIA validation or rights to branded game content; no proprietary extracted game assets |
| Teacher-model output | Research dataset for future distillation | Provider's current terms governing output reuse/model training, institutional guidelines, dataset rights |
| User input / location | User-specified AOI/preferences | Avoid unnecessary personal data, limit logging, and do not publish private locations |

## Practical requirements
1. Add visible, appropriate OSM and PLATEAU attribution in the running UI.
2. Never commit API keys, account credentials, large downloaded datasets, third-party 3D models without redistribution permission, or private participant records.
3. Do not assume that public OSM roads are legally accessible to cars or that the full route can safely host motorsport.
4. This is a **fictional route design / visualization tool**, not a road-closure plan, road-racing instruction, or FIA-compliant track certification.
5. Record which geographic attributes are unavailable; distinguish “unknown” from “valid”.
6. Before distributing source code, discuss a repository-level LICENSE with the lab. In the absence of a license file, no general open-source license is granted.
7. Use openly licensed/test fixtures where possible; keep geospatial preprocessing deterministic and documented.

## First review task
Issue [#9](../issues/9): populate a verified version of the above matrix with authoritative URLs, attribution wording, data provenance, current policy links, and a proposed code-license decision.
